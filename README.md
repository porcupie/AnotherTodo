# Another Todo

This is a little sample iOS project.  Trying to learn to use Split Pane view, UIDocument and Configuration Settings.


## Document App

From (Document Based App Programming Guide)[https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/DocumentBasedAppPGiOS/DocumentArchitectureiniOS/DocumentArchitectureiniOS.html]
Nonetheless, all document-based applications should enable their users to do certain things that require user interface elements; these include the following:

  - Viewing and editing a document
  - Creating a new document
  - Selecting a document from a list of documents owned by the application
  - Opening, closing, and deleting a selected document
  - Putting a selected document in iCloud storage (and removing a selected document from iCloud storage)
  - Indicating error conditions, including document-version conflicts
  - Undoing and redoing changes (recommended but not required)
  - When you design your application, be sure to include the view controllers, views, and controls that are necessary to implement these actions.
